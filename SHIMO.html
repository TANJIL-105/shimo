            <p style="font-size: x-large;">Shimo (霜?), dubbed as Titanus Shimo, is the secondary antagonist of the 2024 sci-fi action crossover film, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the fifth instalment of the MonsterVerse franchise. Shimo's an enormous cryokinetic Titan with ice-based attacks who acts as the unwilling servant of Skar King leading him in ruling over a clan of primate-like Titans due to being controlled by pain inflicted by a mysterious crystal in his possession.
                Not much is known about Shimo's origins, but in the past according to Iwi prophecy, Shimo was once a peaceful and benevolent Titan with cryokinetic powers who was captured by the Skar King and was controlled by him using a blue crystal that would force Shimo to do Skar Kings bidding and cause torture to Shimo, at some point forcing Shimo to start the last great Ice Age. Eventually, Godzilla fought, defeated and imprisoned Skar King along with his army of enslaved Kongs and Shimo in the depths of the Hollow Earth. In the non-canon novelization of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, this is determined by Monarch when they find that the geological layer representing the beginning of this Ice Age was made up of ice specifically caused by Shimo's Frost Bite Breath. This same ice encased Ghidorah after Godzilla defeated him in Antarctica.

                Shimo is a colossal quadrupedal creature, boasting a powerful, robust frame covered in dense reptilian scutes and a striking purplish-white coloration. Shimo’s head possesses two forward-facing eyes and a crest adorned with vibrant dark blue purple spikes. Shimo also possesses a row of translucent purple spikes running down her back and an extremely lengthy tail ending in four thagomizers. Her teeth are surprisingly small for her size and limited in number compared to other titans like Godzilla but are still pointed and sharp, indicating she is either a carnivore, an omnivore or a piscivore
